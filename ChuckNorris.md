Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better! Originally, this is a concept designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.

Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norrisâ€™ method.

 	Rules
Here is the encoding principle:

The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0
A block is separated from another block by a space
Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):
- First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0
- Second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series.


```.js
print(
    readline()
        .split('')
        .map( char => parseInt(char.charCodeAt(0), 10).toString(2).padStart(7, '0'))
        .join('')
        .match(/(\d)\1*/g)
        .map(char => (char[0] === '1' ? '0 ' : '00 ') + '0'.repeat(char.length))
        .join(' ')
);
```
